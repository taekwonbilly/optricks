Optricks
========
Optricks is the programming language for the next generation.

Until now, it has been impossible to attain the five key elements of good programming in a single language: speed, portability, safety, simplicity, and visual efficiency.

C is the master of speed, but lacks portability and forces you to rewrite everything from scratch every time. It also makes it way too easy to shoot yourself in the foot with pointers. C++ writes most of the routines for you, but leaves you with hundreds of conflicting ways to do things while retaining C's lack of portability and safety. Java adds in safety and portability at the expense of speed, simplicity, and visual efficiency -- it simply takes too much overhead to make the simplest program. Python adds back in simplicity, but absolutely destroys performance. Optricks is the first language to provide all five. With your choice of a JIT interpreter or compiler you can still run things at the speed of light (aka C) while keeping the simplicity of generators and a built-in standard library to provide everything you need. Join the revolution and help make Optricks the next language for applications and the next language for the modern web.

<hr/>

The source code for Optricks is now frozen on github in order to allow for a major rewrite of the code base. Since I want to make sure that the public source code on github can always be compiled, the rewrite is taking place on a private repository on my server (thezonecorp.com). If you would like to contribute or see the current source code, please send me an email. This is a major revision and will include new features such as garbage collection, constant detection, allocation demotion from heap to stack, massive speed-ups for the actual compilation process, and a full standard library, among others. The release of this version (1.0.0) is planned for early 2014 and will officially take Optricks out of beta.

However, leading up to this release, the source code will be merged back into this repository to allow for testing and bug-detection before the official release of version 1.0.

Stay tuned and happy coding.
