Optricks
========
Optricks is the programming language for the next generation.

Until now, it has been impossible to attain the five key elements of good programming in a single language: speed, portability, safety, simplicity, and visual efficiency.

C is the master of speed, but lacks portability and forces you to rewrite everything from scratch every time. It also makes it way too easy to shoot yourself in the foot with pointers. C++ writes most of the routines for you, but leaves you with hundreds of conflicting ways to do things while retaining C's lack of portability and safety. Java adds in safety and portability at the expense of speed, simplicity, and visual efficiency -- it simply takes too much overhead to make the simplest program. Python adds back in simplicity, but absolutely destroys performance. Optricks is the first language to provide all five. With your choice of a JIT interpreter or compiler you can still run things at the speed of light (aka C) while keeping the simplicity of generators and a built-in standard library to provide everything you need. Join the revolution and help make Optricks the next language for applications and the next language for the modern web.
